# vision-search-navigation
Repo for the walking robot's vision based navigation code, linked with paper "Real-time Vision-based Navigation for a Legged Robot in an Indoor Environment using High-level Interaction"



## Getting started

This repository features all the offline code used to predict a navigation path. To get started, I highly recommend looking through the code listed in notebooks/staticSegmentedNavigation.ipynb
